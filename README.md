# SimpleTimeService

## Task 1 - Minimalist Application Development / Docker / Kubernetes

### SimpleTimeService - A Simple Microservice in Python

#### Purpose
The **SimpleTimeService** is a lightweight microservice built using Flask. It returns a JSON response that includes:
- **IP address of the client making the request**
- **Current timestamp**

This service is built as a Docker container to ensure easy deployment across different environments.

---

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

#### 1. **Docker**
Docker is needed to build, run, and manage containers.
- **Installation Guide**: [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Verify installation:
  ```sh
  docker --version
  ```

#### 2. **Git**
Git is needed to clone the repository to your local machine.
- **Installation Guide**: [Git Installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Verify installation:
  ```sh
  git --version
  ```

---

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/shivaayrawat/SimpleTimeService.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:
```sh
cd SimpleTimeService
```

---

### Build the Docker Image
Once you've cloned the repository, you can build the Docker image using the following command:
```sh
docker build -t simple-time-service .
```
- `-t simple-time-service` tags the image with the name `simple-time-service`.
- This command may take a few minutes as it pulls the necessary dependencies.

---

### Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, you can run the Docker container. This will start the application on port `5000`.

To run the container in the background:
```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 simple-time-service
```
- `-d` runs the container in **detached mode** (in the background).
- `-p 5000:5000` binds **port 5000** of the container to **port 5000** on your local machine.

---

### Access the Application
After the container is running, you can access the **SimpleTimeService** by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

📌 **URL:** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

The response will be a JSON object that includes the timestamp and IP address of the client:
```json
{
  "ip": "160.191.123.133",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-31T14:45:00.123456"
}
```

---

### Stopping the Container
To stop the running container, use the following command to find the container ID:
```sh
docker ps
```
This will display the currently running containers. Look for the container with the image name **simple-time-service**, and note the container ID.

Stop the container with:
```sh
docker stop <container_id>
```
Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID.

---

### DockerHub Image
The **SimpleTimeService** Docker image has been published to **DockerHub**. You can pull the latest version directly from DockerHub by using the following command:
```sh
docker pull 945shivamrawat/simple-time-service:latest
```

---

## Task 2 - Terraform and Cloud Infrastructure Setup

### Purpose
The goal of Task 2 is to set up infrastructure in AWS using Terraform to host the **SimpleTimeService** containerized application. This infrastructure includes a VPC, subnets, ECS service, load balancer, and other AWS resources.

---

### Prerequisites

#### 1. **Terraform**
Terraform is needed to provision infrastructure in AWS.
- **Installation Guide**: [Terraform Installation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- Verify installation:
  ```sh
  terraform --version
  ```

#### 2. **AWS Account**
Ensure you have an AWS account to create the necessary infrastructure.

#### 3. **AWS CLI**
AWS CLI is used to interact with AWS services from your local machine.
- **Installation Guide**: [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- Verify installation:
  ```sh
  aws --version
  ```

---

### AWS Configuration for Terraform

1. **Create an IAM User**:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to **IAM > Users > Add User**.
   - Provide a name (e.g., `terraform-user`) and select **Programmatic access**.
   - Attach the **AdministratorAccess** policy to the user.
   - Download the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

2. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   Use the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to configure the AWS CLI:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```
   Provide the following details when prompted:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Default region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
   - Default output format: `json`

3. **Create an S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table for Terraform State**:
   Terraform requires a backend to store its state file.
   - Create an S3 bucket:
     ```sh
     aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <your-bucket-name> --region <your-region>
     ```
     Replace `<your-bucket-name>` and `<your-region>` with appropriate values.

   - Enable versioning for the bucket:
     ```sh
     aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <your-bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
     ```

   - Create a DynamoDB table:
     ```sh
     aws dynamodb create-table --table-name <your-table-name> \
       --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
       --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
       --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST
     ```
     Replace `<your-table-name>` with an appropriate value (e.g., `terraform-lock-table`).

4. **Update the Terraform Backend**:
   Update the `backend.tf` file with the following configuration:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket         = "<your-bucket-name>"
       key            = "terraform/state"
       region         = "<your-region>"
       dynamodb_table = "<your-table-name>"
     }
   }
   ```
   Replace `<your-bucket-name>`, `<your-region>`, and `<your-table-name>` with the values you created earlier.

---

### Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   Navigate to the `Terraform/` directory and initialize Terraform:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. **Validate the Configuration**:
   Validate the Terraform configuration files:
   ```sh
   terraform validate
   ```

3. **Plan the Infrastructure**:
   Generate a plan to see what resources will be created:
   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the Configuration**:
   Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure:
   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```
   Confirm the changes by typing `yes` when prompted.

---

### Accessing the Application
Once the infrastructure is deployed, the load balancer's DNS name will be provided as an output.

📌 Access the application using the load balancer URL. The response will include the timestamp and IP address in JSON format:
```json
{
  "ip": "160.191.123.133",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-31T14:45:00.123456"
}
```

---

### Clean Up
To destroy the resources created by Terraform:
```sh
terraform destroy
```
Confirm the destruction by typing `yes` when prompted.
